# Creates the non-root user ubuntu.
# Configures the sudoers file to allow the ubuntu user to run sudo commands without a password prompt.
# Adds the public key in your local machine (usually ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the remote ubuntu userâ€™s authorized key list. 
# This will allow you to SSH into each server as the ubuntu user.
